## Overview

Managing vSphere machines using the Puppet DSL.

## Description

## Setup

### Requirements

* Puppet 3.4 or greater
* Ruby 1.9 or greater
* RBVMOMI Ruby gem

### Installing the vSphere module

1. First install the required dependencies

  * If you're using open source Puppet, the vsphere and hocon library should be installed
     into the same Ruby used by Puppet. Install the gem with:

      `gem install rbvmomi hocon`

  * If you're running Puppet Enterprise, install the gem with this command:

      `/opt/puppet/bin/gem install rbvmomi hocon`

    This allows the gem to be used by the Puppet Enterprise Ruby.

  * If you're running [Puppet Server](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-server), you need to make the gem available to JRuby with:

      `/opt/puppet/bin/puppetserver gem install rbvmomi hocon`

    Once the gems are installed, restart Puppet Server.

2. Set the following environment variables specific to your vSphere
   installation:

  * Required Settings:
      ~~~
      export VSPHERE_SERVER='your-host'
      export VSPHERE_USER='your-username'
      export VSPHERE_PASSWORD='your-password'
      ~~~

  * Optional Settings:
      ~~~
      # To ignore SSL certificate errors. Defaults to true.
      export VSPHERE_INSECURE='true or false'

      # Whether to use SSL. Defaults to true.
      export VSPHERE_SSL='true or false'

      # Sets vSphere server port to connect to. Defaults to 443(SSL) or 80(non-SSL).
      export VSPHERE_PORT='your-port'
      ~~~

   Alternatively you can provide the information in a configuration
file. This should be stored as `vsphere.conf` in the relevant
[confdir](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/dirs_confdir.html). This should be:

   * nix Systems: /etc/puppetlabs/puppet
   * Windows: C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\puppet\etc
   * non-root users: ~/.puppetlabs/etc/puppet

   The file format is:

      ~~~
      vsphere: {
        host: your-host
        user: your-username
        password: your-password
      }
      ~~~

   Or with all the settings:

      ~~~
      vsphere: {
        host: your-host
        user: your-username
        password: your-password
        port: your-port
        insecure: false
        ssl: false
      }
      ~~~

    Note that you can use either the environment variables or the config file. If both are present the environment variables will be used.
    You cannot have some setting in environment variables and the others in the config file.

3. Finally install the module with:

     `puppet module install puppetlabs-vsphere`


## Getting started with vSphere

This module allows for describing a vSphere machine using the Puppet
DSL. To create a new machine from a template or other machine:

~~~
vsphere_machine { '/opdx1/vm/eng/sample':
  ensure => present,
  source => '/opdx1/vm/eng/source',
  memory => 1024,
  cpus   => 1,
}
~~~

The module also supports listing and managing machines via `puppet resource`:

    puppet resource vsphere_machine

Note that this will output some read-only information about the machine,
for instance:

~~~
vsphere_machine { '/opdx1/vm/eng/sample':
  ensure                      => 'present',
  compute                     => 'general1',
  cpu_reservation             => '0',
  cpus                        => '1',
  guest_ip                    => '10.32.99.41',
  hostname                    => 'debian',
  instance_uuid               => '501870f2-f891-879f-2bb7-f87023789959',
  memory                      => '1024',
  memory_reservation          => '0',
  number_ethernet_cards       => '1',
  power_state                 => 'poweredOn',
  snapshot_disabled           => 'false',
  snapshot_locked             => 'false',
  snapshot_power_off_behavior => 'powerOff',
  template                    => 'false',
  tools_installer_mounted     => 'false',
  uuid                        => '4218419b-3b98-18ca-e77f-93b567dda463',
}
~~~

The read-only properties are documented in the reference section below.

The module also supports customizing a vSphere machine using the Puppet DSL. To
modify an existing machine:

**Note** Customizing a running vSphere machine will perform a reboot of the machine.

~~~
vsphere_machine { '/opdx1/vm/eng/sample':
  ensure       => present,
  memory       => 1024,
  cpus         => 1,
  extra_config => {
    'advanced.setting' => 'value',
  }
}
~~~

You can also specify that a newly launched machine should be a linked
clone. Linked clones share a disk with the source machine.

~~~
vsphere_machine { '/opdx1/vm/eng/sample':
  ensure       => present,
  source       => '/opdx1/vm/eng/source',
  linked_clone => true,
}
~~~

You can also delete the machine we created above by setting the `ensure`
property to `absent` in the manifest or using `puppet resouce` like so:

    puppet resource vsphere_machine /opdx1/vm/eng/garethr-test ensure=absent

To only remove the machine's definition, but leave the underlying configuration
and disk files in place, you can set `ensure` to `unregistered`:

    puppet resource vsphere_machine /opdx1/vm/eng/garethr-test ensure=unregistered

Please note that the module currently provides no mechanism to clean up the
files left behind by this operation.

### A note on datacenters

By default we will use the default datacenter for your installation. If
this fails or if you have multiple virtual datacenters on vSphere you
can specify which datacenter you are managing using the
`VSPHERE_DATACENTER` environment variable like so:

    VSPHERE_DATACENTER=my-datacenter puppet resource vpshere_machine

This can also be set in the config file as `datacenter`.


## Usage

## References

### Types

* `vsphere_machine`: Manages a vSphere virtual machine.

### Parameters

#### Type: vsphere_machine

#####`ensure`
Specifies the basic state of the resource. Valid values are 'present', 'running',
stopped', 'unregistered', and 'absent'. Defaults to 'present'.
* 'present', 'running': ensure that the VM is up and running. If the VM is not
  there yet, a new one will be created as specified by the other properties.
* 'stopped': ensure that the VM is created, but not running.
* 'unregistered': ensure that the VM is not under active management in vSphere.
  This will keep the vmx/vhd files around.
* 'absent': ensure that the VM and all its files are removed.
If the machine is a template then only present, absent and unregistered
are valid states.

#####`name`
*Required* The full path for the machine, including the datacenter
identifier.

#####`compute`
The name of the compute resource in which to launch the
machine. Defaults to the default resource pool for the datacenter.

#####`source`
The path within the specified datacenter to the virtual machine or
template to base the new virtual machine on. Specifying a source
is required when specifying `ensure => 'present'`.

#####`template`
Whether or not the machine is a template. Defaults to false.

#####`memory`
The amount of memory to allocate to the new machine. Defaults to the
same as the template or source machine.

#####`cpus`
